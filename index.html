            Hi, I'm Tom Tramita! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I’m Tom, a product designer transitioning into a full-stack software engineer. 
            With a strong background in UX/UI, I’m now focusing on both front-end and back-end development. 
            I’m passionate about creating user-centered applications and bridging the gap between design and code. 
            I’m excited to combine my creativity and technical skills to build innovative solutions.
